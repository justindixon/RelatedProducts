<!--## Installing

Related Products is available as both an unlocked package and a managed package. The metadata is the same in both packages, but there are some differences in the available functionality & features. All examples in `README` are for the unlocked package (no namespace) - simply add the `Nebula` namespace to the examples if you are using the managed package.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Unlocked Package (Recommended)</th>
            <th>Managed Package</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Namespace</td>
            <td>none</td>
            <td><code></code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Future Releases</td>
            <td>Faster release cycle: new patch versions are released (e.g., <code>v4.4.x</code>) for new enhancements & bugfixes that are merged to the <code>main</code> branch in GitHub</td>
            <td>Slower release cycle: new minor versions are only released (e.g., <code>v4.x</code>) once new enhancements & bugfixes have been tested and code is stabilized</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Public & Protected Apex Methods</td>
            <td>Any <code>public</code> and <code>protected</code> Apex methods are subject to change in the future - they can be used, but you may encounter deployment issues if future changes to <code>public</code> and <code>protected</code> methods are not backwards-compatible</td>
            <td>Only <code>global</code> methods are available in managed packages - any <code>global</code> Apex methods available in the managed package will be supported for the foreseeable future</td>
        </tr>
